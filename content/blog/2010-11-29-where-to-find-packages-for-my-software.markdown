If for some inexplicable reason anybody would like to check out any of my
software in Ubuntu, just add my PPA:

<del>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ilkka/ilkka-ppa</del>
<pre><code class="language-sh">
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ilkka/myppa
</code></pre>

There's not much there but I'll try to push releases there on a regular basis,
to get a hang of the workflow if for nothing else.

<ins>There's also a snapshot ppa with, yes, snapshot versions, at
`ppa:ilkka/snapshot`.</ins>
