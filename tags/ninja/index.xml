      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I hit upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/martine/ninja&#34;&gt;Ninja&lt;/a&gt;, a very fast
and very simple build system that is apparently used for building
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chromium.org/&#34;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;. Can&amp;rsquo;t remember where I first heard of
it, might&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; or just
somebody&amp;rsquo;s tweet, but having been interested in build systems for years, at
least since setting up Linux builds from scratch for a big piece of software
while working on my M.Sc. thesis, I immediately started playing around with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninja is indeed fast, but by design the buildfiles are hard to write. Ninja
sources include a patch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/gyp&#34;&gt;Gyp&lt;/a&gt;, a higher-level
build system also somehow (not sure how exactly) related to Chromium, but the
support wasn&amp;rsquo;t very complete, and somehow I just didn&amp;rsquo;t find Gyp appealing. I
therefore did what anyone in my circumstances would&amp;rsquo;ve done, and started
writing a &amp;ldquo;meta build system&amp;rdquo; myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ilkka/jitsu&#34;&gt;Jitsu&lt;/a&gt;, and since I really like
Ruby, that&amp;rsquo;s what I wrote it in. It&amp;rsquo;s at version 0.1.2 now and available from
rubygems.org, and as of now it can build (or rather, generate ninja buildfiles
for) C++ binaries and static libraries. Builds are specified as &lt;code&gt;build.jitsu&lt;/code&gt;
files in YAML format, which the tool processes into &lt;code&gt;build.ninja&lt;/code&gt; files that
can then be used by Ninja. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep trying to use it in my own projects so
hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll keep on improving from here on out. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where it will
go, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really delineated the scope yet, to e.g. just doing C++ builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, install the gem, maybe &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ilkka/jitsu&#34;&gt;grab the
source&lt;/a&gt; and give it a spin. Let me know what
you think. Also see &lt;a href=&#34;http://ilkka.github.com/jitsu&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
