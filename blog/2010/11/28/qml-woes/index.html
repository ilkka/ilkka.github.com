                <p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-components">Qt
Components</a> recently, even though they
are very much in a pre-alpha state. I think that QML together with the
excellent PySide bindings holds great promise as a crossplatform environment
for mobile app development, even more so than Qt + QML, since there&rsquo;s no need
to set up toolchains for compilation and linking. I&rsquo;m hoping to write many
apps in this manner, implementing ideas that I&rsquo;ve had banging around in my
head for a while now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been building the &ldquo;mx&rdquo; or Maemo flavor of Qt Components myself from the
Git repo, but a couple of days ago I came across blog posts by <a href="http://qt-funk.blogspot.com/2010/10/fresh-from-oven-qt-extras-for-ubuntu.html">Attila
Csipa</a>
and <a href="http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/blog/kate-alholas-forum-nokia-blog/2010/11/14/how-to-make-modern-mobile-applications-with-qt-quick-components">Kate
Alhola</a>
where I read to my great exitement that there&rsquo;s a PPA with binary packages of
Qt Components for Ubuntu, and that Fremantle packages are available in extras.
This is the ideal combo for me, since I do my development on Ubuntu machines
and my current target would be my N900 running Fremantle.</p>

<p>Excitement soon turned to disappointment, however, when I noticed that the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~forumnokia/+archive/fn-ppa/+packages">binaries for Maverick are failing to
build</a>. The
problem seems to be that Qt Components wants to <code>#include &lt;mclassfactory.h&gt;</code>,
but <code>libmeegotouch-dev</code> doesn&rsquo;t publish <code>mclassfactory.h</code> as a public header,
instead treating it as a private one. I downloaded the source packages for
both, made <code>mclassfactory.h</code> public and rebuilt <code>libmeegotouch</code> and
<code>qt-components</code> in their entirety.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve only had a chance to do some very preliminary tests on the
desktop, but it looks promising: things seem to work pretty much as expected,
and making QML UIs is not just drawing lines and aligning textboxes anymore.</p>

<p>On the N900 I fared a little worse though: I installed <code>qt-components-dev</code>,
quickly typed a QML file that just had a single <code>com.meego.Window</code> element in
it and gave it to <code>qt4-qmlviewer</code> to show, and it managed to display a window
where the top <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> was red and the rest black. Better than nothing, I guess.</p>

<p>So, it seems like my ideal mobile development environment has a ways to go,
then. I&rsquo;ll have to see what the state of the art <em>really</em> is on the N900 after
I get something working on the desktop. It&rsquo;s also a bit of a bother that I
can&rsquo;t install <code>qt-components</code> in Scratchbox. It&rsquo;d be nice to not have to copy
stuff to the N900 every time I want to try out something. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to
solve that through some remote directory mounting over USB-net, then.</p>
